# WiseKnight

This android application renders all possible paths a knight can legally take between two chess squares if the destination can be reached in 3 moves. 

If no path is found it displays a message that no solution is possible.

The user can choose the size of the board between 6 and 16 squares per size and can continue rendering as many paths as he wants by simply choosing again. 

All paths are shown in random colors and as long as they are valid (within bounds and up to 3 moves) all paths are rendered. 

You can find screenshots of the application running for boards of different sizes and paths of different complexities in the main folder of the repository.
